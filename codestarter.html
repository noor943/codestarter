     <h1> Welcome to CodeStarter! </h1>
     <p> This is my first step into the world of web development. As a student learning HTML, I'm using this site to experiment, build, and grow my skills from the ground up. Every section, tag, and line of code here is part of my journey to becoming a better developer. Stay tuned as I explore new concepts, create fun projects, and turn simple code into real web experiences. This is just the beginning â€” let's build the future, one tag at a time.</p>
